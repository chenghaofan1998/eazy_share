# LongShot MVP

Browser extension MVP for long screenshots on Feishu docs and generic web pages.

## Features
- Full-page long capture
- Area selection capture
- Output height limit
- Auto split to 3/6/9 grids
- Optional Feishu QR footer (last/all pages)
- Grid export is generated by slicing one composed long image (single capture flow).

## Quick Start
1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select `src/extension`

## Usage
1. Open a Feishu doc or web page.
2. Click extension icon.
3. Optional: click **Select Area on Page** and draw region.
4. Choose output mode (`Single Long Image` / `3/6/9 Grid`).
5. Optional: fill Feishu URL and placement.
6. Click **Capture & Export**.
7. For `3/6/9 Grid`, a split editor opens where you can drag split lines, then export.

Exports are saved under `Downloads/longshot/`.

## Test
Run:

```bash
npm test
```

## Notes
- This is an MVP; sticky/fixed headers on complex pages can still cause occasional seams.
- Feishu link is rendered as a QR card footer; if QR fetch fails, URL text is still shown.
